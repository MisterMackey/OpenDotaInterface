!! try refactoring the parser to call the jsoncovert.deserialize straight on the json string to see if it does the job w/o manually selecting the tokens i want
	that way i can just add properties to my classes for the tokens i want

the current match class has several properties of type JObject because there is too much data in those tokens to just simply put in
	--> design new classes that can hold relevant information contained in those JObjects and extend the factory to fill those classes and set 
	references to them in the match object so that the match object has a property which is another dboobject

code JSON parser that creates dbo's out of the raw text
	make list of items to exclude, format this list properly and load it into program somehow

create methods to write dbo's to database

create configuration tables for heroes/items/other stuff
